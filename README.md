## Hi there 👋

- 🤷‍♂️ My name is David Rodríguez, but usually people call me Deivid.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on on maintaining the official package managers for the Ruby language, [Bundler & RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), thanks to Ruby Central that sponsors my work.

- 🐛 I love fixing bugs and making software more stable and less surprising. I care a lot about backwards compatibility and try to be empathetic towards the users of the software I develop.

- 📆 In the past I've worked as a freelance software engineer implementing new features and improving several open source Ruby projects, such as the participatory democracy framework [decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim), which gave me good understanding of the Rails framework, or Github's [Dependabot Updates](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/), where I learnt about common challenges and particularities of the different package manager ecosystems.

- 🤓 I have a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, but I don't really recall much about that 😅.
